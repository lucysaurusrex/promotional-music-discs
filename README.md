Minecraft has a lot of good promotional music that sadly isn't used in-game, this mod adds some of that music by adding new Music Discs that can all be found in Survival mode.

[Creakstep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7Ps4PQBDIA) can be found in Woodland Mansion chests.

The [Minecraft Live 2022 theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgrf26cNSro) can be found in Minehsafts.

[Infinite Spooky Amethyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LTyoXWfIZE) can be found in Ancient Cities.

The Music Disc textures were created by Zphen.
